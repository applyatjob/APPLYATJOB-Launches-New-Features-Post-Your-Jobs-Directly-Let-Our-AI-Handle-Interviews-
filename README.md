# APPLYATJOB-Launches-New-Features-Post-Your-Jobs-Directly-Let-Our-AI-Handle-Interviews
We are thrilled to announce two major upgrades on APPLYATJOB, your go-to platform for job listings and hiring solutions. Our goal has always been to connect employers with the right candidates quickly and efficiently — and with these latest features, we’re making that journey smoother than ever.
Post Your Own Jobs Directly on Our Website:
Previously, employers or companies looking to hire needed to go through multiple steps or external channels to get their jobs listed on APPLYATJOB. Now, we have launched a powerful new feature that allows any visitor or employer to post their own jobs directly on our website.
This means you, as an employer or recruiter, no longer need intermediaries. You can simply log on to our platform, fill in your job details, and have your vacancy live on the site within minutes.
Why is this important?
-  You save time by posting directly.
- Your jobs become instantly visible to thousands of job seekers.
- You have full control over your job listings — edit, update, or remove them anytime.
- It’s user-friendly and designed for both small businesses and big companies.
By making job posting accessible and direct, we are helping you speed up the hiring process and reach the right audience when you need them.
New Game-Changer: AI-Powered Interviews
But we didn’t stop there. APPLYATJOB is proud to roll out another groundbreaking feature:
When candidates apply for your posted job, our advanced AI system will now conduct their initial interview for you.
Yes, you heard that right!
Our platform has an integrated AI that steps in as soon as someone applies for a job. The AI interviews the candidates, asking relevant questions based on your job description, and records their answers. It then analyzes responses, screens applicants, and shortlists the best matches — all before you even review the applications.
